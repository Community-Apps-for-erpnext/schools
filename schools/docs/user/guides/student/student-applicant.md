### Application Status

- By default when a student applicant is created in the system, the application status is set to 'Applied'

- You can update the status to 'Approved' once you approve the applicant to join the applied program at your institute.

- Once the application status is set to 'Approved', 'Create Student' button shall appear on the document. 
	You can create a student record against the student applicant by clicking on this button.
	
- Once a student is created against the student applicant, the system shall set the application status to 'Admitted' 
	and will not allow you to change the application status unless the student record is deleted.
